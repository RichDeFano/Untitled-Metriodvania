---------------------------------NEEDED FOR ENGINE------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Physics System:
	--STATUS: INCOMPLETE
	--ADDED: Ice, Water, Hookshot, Movement all share a common extra momentum. Dash jumping added.
		Multiple types of terrain(slowing liquids, non climbable/hookshotable walls)
		-Needed
			dash + quickly press back = wavedash/backdash
			hookshot needs a max speed 
			hookshot doesnt draw misfire
			hookshot down gives too much momentum.
			sword while dashing? or speed up dash. dash speed could be like a roll
			lava (platforms bubbling up), light boots let you walk slowly	
			wall slide momentum - up if you have enough(expecially on ice)
			//grabbing ledges and climbing up/dropping down on ledge(only if you have wall cling)? wall cling might make it feel clunky
			hookshot on enemy should be different for each armor
				moon(switch positions)
				sun(charge opponent and stun them if they arent shielding)
				normal(short stun
			
		Water Stuff:
			need wavy top of water, right now its just flat
			need collision with water surface to cause ripples
			
			Water jet additions
				non passable with dashing
					non passable should do one of the following: turn you around, do dmg, act as a no climb wall/give a little velocity
				can plug/turn off with rocks/switches/etc.
				sprites instead of dots
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPGRADES(Sun and Moon):
	--ADDED: Shrine System STATUS: INCOMPLETE
		-Sun Armor
			-Sword: Greatsword. Low combo potential. all swings have knockback. causes confusion/stun or maybe a burn effect
			-Armor: Slowly heals you outside of combat(needs to be very slow), higher blink/hitstun time
			-Movement: dash leaves behind a flashbang, will stun unless the enemy is fast enough to turn around
			-Counter: Armored shell, will confuse/stun enemies on successful parry. you dont swing sword
		-Moon Armor
			-Sword: Dual tantos/Scimitars. One forward one back. High combo potential/neutral A is repeatable
			-Armor: out of combat semi invis to sneak around enemies. lower blink time means you get comboed easier.
			-Movement: zed shadow marker. 
			-Counter: possible wavedash style jump back and swing?
		-Dual Armor
			-Sword:
			-Armor:
			-Movement:
			-Counter: Parry/Riposte
			
			armor bonus is given by meditating - staying idle for a while.
			no armor meditate stops status effects from harming you any further
			enemies will do double dmg if they break your meditation
			
------------------------------------------------------------------------------				
COMBAT:
	--ADDED: Sword Mechanics. STATUS: INCOMPLETE
		--Needed
			-Smooth out combat
			-Enemies attacking back
			-Fighting patterns for each armor cleaned up
			-Base Character
				-Sword: Rapier/Saber. Combos have hitstun at the end, slices can inflict bleed.
				-Armor: N/A
				-Movement: Dash Upgrade
				-Counter: Parry/Riposte
				
				
			holding down puts up a block(stamina gain /2)
			pressing button causes the parry to go off
			
			Parrying beats heavy hits(counters their momentum)
			heavy hits beat short hits(no hitstun to stop you)
			short hits beats parrying(can only block one hit, but then left open as you swing/thrust back)
			
			blocks stop short hits
			bocks on heavies will cause both players to clink on
			
			short hits have no hitstun, but multiple short hits will cause bleed
			heavy hits have hitstun/momentum, but has recovery frames for player(still should be able to combo though)
			
			the same kind of hit will clink with enemy. depending on your armor, the recovery time will be short(moon) to long(sun)
			
			moon combat about getting a few strikes in and then repositioning/dodging/parrying big moves
				moon combat in air is very flashy
				should always feel faster than opponent
				should usually be able to dodge abilities as long as you dont commit to one more attack
				
				weak if caught out
				weak to heavies
			
			sun combat is about getting in one large hit.
				can rush enemies that are overly aggro and tank a hit or two
				can break shield with end of combo/some arials
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENEMIES:
	--ADDED: obj_enemyParent. STATUS: INCOMPLETE
		-need to flesh out character moveset before enemies can be designed around it
		
		range+support, damage dealer+swordsman, tank+distraction?
		swordsman will always try to engage you, expecially if you are running at a mage/range
		mage/range will try to evade and support, while doing dmg if they arent being pursued
		
		Sun enemies
			Mages:
				could have a staff or glow on arms to visualise incoming attacks(color may help too)
				long animations, ranged attacks. no good melee defense or shielding. small hits can be blocked with sword
				depends on the elements they are near(water, fire from torches/lava, earth in caves, nature in forest/swamp)
				should have a move to distance from player, an aggressive projectile, an airial, and a team help
					Water: waterbend jets to push player out of range
						       create ice needles and throw them at player one at a time(very quick linear motion)	
						       tsunami to jump high in the air(could do more needles down/at player)
						       can cause fog to reduce visibility(spell glow goes through fog, gets worse if you leave him unharmed)
					Fire: simple fireball
					      lava projectile that creates lava pillars on surface
					      manipulate light sources?
					      ring of fire spin in air(more defensive/ make player stand back)
					      lights enemies swords on fire for burn on hit
					Earth:
						send rocks at target
						hit the floor that causes the player to trip/get knocked
						can walk on walls/ceiling, and quick pillar shoot in a direction
						other enemies cannot be knocked away, feet are set in stone
						dropping/moving boulders and stalagmites
					      
			Swordsman(dark knight/iron knuckle style:
				sword + shield/longsword/greatsword
					S&S: good at blocking, not great at killing you. simple swings/jumps. possibly a roll
					longsword: a little slower, but has a parry.
					greatsword: big combo finishers if buffed(one special for each element
					
			--------
			Moon enemies:
			
				Assassin:
					sword class with quick attacks, lots of rolling, and wall climbing abilities.
					higher tiers should have partial stealth(shimmering/mirror effect)
					highest tiers should charge their sword before lightning strikes, use it as a large slash/combo finisher?
					parry is naruto log style hit
				Ranger:
					sniper esque class that likes to hide in corners or out of sight and aim. the bullet should have an SAO trail? the bullet should be a 						lightning bolt and be very fast. if the trail is up for more than half the time before sword swing it should hit you.
				technomancer:
					can cause weather effects so its harder to see(storms). if storming lightning can randomly strike(1/10ish chance of hitting you, 6/10 						being close, 3/10 being far. can use the lightning to teleport around
					can make metal surfaces dangerous
					set shock traps to block off horizontal/vertical spots
					can give enemies speed boost
			----
			Neutral
				in overworld, passages between levels, outside towns, etc.
				Things like bats, lava beetles, fish, hawks, etc. will always attack you
				
			--Rouges/banished
				most everywhere
				no faction
				will always attack you. more like other human enemies(sword combat, jumping, countering, etc)
			
			moon enemies will fight all sun enemies(you in armor)
			sun enemies will fight all moon enemies(you in armor)
			they will leave you alone until you aggro something in the area(screen? few screens? what feels natural. maybe save resets aggro not for that screen)
