Gem having one/two/three div
get one looking good before making two or three
can connect in clusters or solo

algorithm for spawning a random cluster 9X9 max? would handle glow and reduce tiles, as all gems could be in one sprite.
also i could make one large glow around the sprite, or maybe spawn each one its glow
also i could animate the glow to go in and out slowly(should do anyways for torch in general. maybe even player)



Green cave merges into platform 
green cave twists up like gem rock platform
all caves twist up like that
new floors that look more natural. bigger rocks, less details.
