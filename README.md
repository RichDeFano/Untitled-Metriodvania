# Untitled-Metriodvania
A metroidvania inspired 2D platformer made in Game Maker Studio 2.


Each folder is a semi random cutoff point. When I feel like I have made good progress on a mechanic, I will save it and start on a
new file for backup purposes, in case anything gets too messed up. 

Each folder does not contain the necessary compiler, and you will not be able to choose a random iteration and compile it unless you own
a copy of Game Maker Studio 2, most likely needing the paid version as well. I will include an executable for those looking to
try out a version, and try to keep that as updated as possible.

The game is still in the engine stages. Once a few more big tasks can be added, the game will have the ability to gain new content rapidly
and that is when areas/bosses/story will start to come together in a playable state.

Tasks needed to complete engine
-In depth combat/enemy design
-Boss design
-Save System.
