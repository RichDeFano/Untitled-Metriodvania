# Untitled-Metriodvania
A metroidvania inspired 2D platformer made in Game Maker Studio 2.


Each folder is a semi random cutoff point. When I feel like I have made good progress on a mechanic, I will save it and start on a
new file for backup purposes, in case anything gets too messed up. 

Each folder does not contain the necessary compiler, and you will not be able to choose a random iteration and compile it unless you own
a copy of Game Maker Studio 2, most likely needing the paid version as well. I will include an executable for those looking to
try out a version, and try to keep that as updated as possible. The game's mechanics are starting to come together well, but this is still just the engine. There is not much(if anything) in terms of well designed levels, story/dialouge, etc. 

As of July 2020, the physics/movement engine is getting a large revamp to eventually aid in updating the combat as well. The goal is to make all movement and combat options fluid to the player. Once these few tasks can be added, the game will have the ability to gain new content rapidly in the art/story/world building areas.

That is when areas/bosses/story will start to come together in a playable state. I have not decided whether the code will stay open source once the engine is complete.
Progress.txt gives a slight rundown on some of the mechanics in the game. Currently, the two big hurdles involve making the combat feel smooth and interactive for the player, as well as balancing the armors around their playstyle.
