----Hookshot Ideas----
Go further with grappling hook, could be really cool combat wise 
If hookshot always pulls you vs getting to grappling hook with it 
Grappling hook for platform /level design, could be a cool mechanic 
Trigger holds the hook, gamepad or mouse directs it. Holding trigger pulls you in hookshot style, otherwise it just latches to the wall and is a swing
Swing should save momentum from whether you are moving or not, also be hard to build up swing 
swing is released by jump or dash into those mechanics 
Have to drop down spikes rope style, then swing up to a ledge or up a walljump corridor with some spikes
Walljump beats rope in things like MegaMan, the closing room. 
Might make jumpblocks semi obsolete unless Incorporated in long swings with no surface or up places you can't grapple or wallclimb 
faint shield glow around character showing general direction
affected by special charge
	fire or lightning trail, one shocks(mini stuns) one does dot
	sword upgrade renamed weapon

----Combat Ideas----
Fast paced combo, enemies have multiple directional attacks(if you dash they might swing around their back)
Strong enemies punish basic player mistakes 
Attacks are fast
Should feel like dodging in and out of range to exchange a hit with enemy while they have frame cooldowns,
Npc enemies could ramp up/have ranks shown by a badge or armor trim or something
-one that runs at you and dash attack swipes every time is easy to beat 
-next rank up might protect himself by swinging around in a ganondorf swipe
-next rank might fake a dash and swipe you in the air
Flurry rush?

Hookshotting enemy shields to pull them off/jump to them(if they are stronger?)
if they are too strong to pull their shield you can hold it until they swing, putting their shield behind
gives a blinking indicator to jump behind them or something?
using your sword while on your hookshot? too much?
enemies can usually block hookshot from the front
(fire sword makes that impossible?)


---Area: Falcons Den---
Falcons den, has long section to pass 
Since late game, you will have most everything 
Mountain range with long drops, need hook to climb. Aus mountain good example 
Not many secrets, not many saves, kinda ass.

have to lower yourself and then swing one of two ways. both ways have only jumpblocks. one way you need to hookshot to something?
youre climbing the mountain, most of bottom right/left should be drops while the mountain goes up the side/above you. some horizontal mostly vertical.
as you get higher there is a wind gust, first when youre on ledge and barely moving you. will mess up rope.
