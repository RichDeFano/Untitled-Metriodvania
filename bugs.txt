BUGS:
	need to check gamepad before updating in counter
	counter shouldnt activate on initial click
	**check on multiple resolution computers**
	minimap doesnt always start in same spot
	map screen doesnt move correctly, bottom right is cut off - might be a resolution issue?
	cave might be too dark - need light from enemies, lava, gems, etc. darkest setting should be set according to brightness 	 of screen?
	-------	
	image angle not changing on slopes - cant break collision

	HOOKSHOT FIXES:
		//cant tell if hookshot holds momentum or not
		//hookshot can be quickly shot off twice
		//can spam click hookshot if it isnt going to make it
		//no hookshot walls - different as no dash walls. need both.
		//room transitions /shooting out of room
		//player not moving in the center - causes hookshot from wall to right to fail, causes shadow disparity
		player horizontal speed should be capped for movement, and then have a slightly higher cap for things like 			rope/big dash/wall 			dash. preserved between rooms
		hookshot drops when you release the button
		clicking down doesnt give proper momentum
		if platform moves out of range of x and y, the hookshot wont hit the bottom of moving platform correctly
		hookshot is drawn super extended even on hit(its onlyif its below you though)
		hookshot doesnt attach if it hits a platform pre where its supposed to be
	General -
		//swinging sword while on hookshot
		//Upgrade counter on menu says 9/10 when at 10/10
		theres a little fall after warping. might be fixed by moving sprite
		if youre swinging sword and heading towards a platform, you float at 2x speed
		room transitions have draw issues, old screen flashes on screen for a few frames
		opening menu when money is coming at you causes segfault
		minimap can start too close to border - if x/y is past the movement ones
		dashing up slopes doesnt work
