BUGS:
	need to check gamepad before updating in counter
	counter shouldnt activate on initial click
	**check on multiple resolution computers**
	minimap doesnt always start in same spot
	map screen doesnt move correctly, bottom right is cut off - might be a resolution issue?
	cave might be too dark - need light from enemies, lava, gems, etc. darkest setting should be set according to brightness 	 of screen?
	-------	
	image angle not changing on slopes - cant break collision

	HOOKSHOT FIXES:
		//cant tell if hookshot holds momentum or not
		//hookshot can be quickly shot off twice
		//can spam click hookshot if it isnt going to make it
		//no hookshot walls - different as no dash walls. need both.
		//room transitions /shooting out of room
		//player not moving in the center - causes hookshot from wall to right to fail, causes shadow disparity
		//player horizontal speed should be capped for movement, and then have a slightly higher cap for things like 				
		//rope/big dash/walldash. preserved between rooms
		//hookshot drops when you release the button
		//hookshot auto reloads if you are still holding the button
		//hookshot doesnt attach if it finds a new block on a missed fire

		//clicking down doesnt give proper momentum
		//if platform moves out of range of x and y, the hookshot wont hit the bottom of moving platform correctly
		//hookshot doesnt attach if it hits a platform pre where its supposed to be
		//hookshot doesnt draw misfire
		//hookshot not attaching to moving platforms correctly
		
		hookshot down gives too much momentum.(semi fixed by having you slide when hitting)
		hookshot needs to be affected by water jets
		hookshot needs a max speed - you can give yourself way too much momentum
		hookshot is drawn super extended even on hit(its onlyif its below you though)
		hookshot from above hemisphere gives too much acceleration
		///////////*********************
		///////////New System needed - hookshot being under control of hsp and extra hsp
		gravity effects you 
		
		

	WATER FIXES:
		//cant be affected by multiple jets
		.//there is momentum when you first go to a new screen
		
	COMBAT FIXES:
		//lunge doesnt hold momentum if you release button early
		//lunge momentum doesnt decrease, always constant
		//you cannot change directions on an arial once you start it
		//something broke dash
		//can jump while swinging
		//gravity issues
		//can lunge without stopping
		/lunging off a platform causes you to float
		
		enemy knockback needs to scale with weight difference and ability base
		enemy knockback needs to be angled for each(possibly hardcoded?)
		enemies need to switch between idle/roam/def/attack based on player position
		testing if logic is sound for weapon clinking once attacks are in
		
		if enemy is knocked into a wall it should be stunned.
		enemies should be affected by status effects(burning, poison, bleed, etc)
		
		player return physics is very broken- needs enemyhitbox
		
	ENEMY FIXES:
		enemies should be hit away from the player - in any angle
		enemies should lose most of their hsp on landing
		enemies should one of four alliances
			Neutral(does not attack unless provoked)
			Sun
			Moon
			Rouge(attacks most anything, pref player)
		
	ARMOR FIXES:
		//Add damageblink to shadow armor
			stealth should block projectiles. everything else will cancel stealth. attacking or blocking will cancel 			stealth.
		//Add slowhearts to sun armor
			in combat flames should come up if you are against 3+ enemies.
		Add meditate pose
	
	MOVEMENT FIXES:
		Need sun/moon dash to cause knockback and status effects
		//Need to shorten all/some dashes
		//dashing up slopes doesnt work
		//remove zed shadow(too clunky)
		//dash jumping and then turning around still gives a little momentum
	General -
		//swinging sword while on hookshot
		//Upgrade counter on menu says 9/10 when at 10/10
		//if youre swinging sword and heading towards a platform, you float at 2x speed
		room transitions have draw issues, old screen flashes on screen for a few frames
		opening menu when money is coming at you causes segfault
		minimap can start too close to border - if x/y is past the movement ones
		water shader looks really bad on laptop
		light filter looks bad on laptop
		theres a little fall after warping. might be fixed by moving sprite
